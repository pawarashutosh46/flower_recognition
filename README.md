>OBJECTIVE

To create an effective model using the Convolutional Neural Network for flower image classification, using the images of Dandelion and Tulip.

>INTRODUCTION

A flower recognition model was created using the CNN Architecture. The input data was of two flowers, specifically, Dandelion and Tulip; two distinct flowers that have distinctive features. It was obtained from the Internet. The Dandelion is the only flower that depicts the sun, moon, and stars, the three heavenly bodies. The sun is represented by the golden flower, the moon is represented by the puff ball, and the stars are represented by the dispersed seeds. The dandelion flower blooms in the morning and shuts to sleep in the evening. The root leaves, and flower of the dandelion are all edible. It can be used in food, medicine, and as a dye.
Tulips are tall flowers with long, wide, parallel-veined leaves and a single or double cup-shaped bloom at the stem's top. The blossoms come in a variety of colors, from red to yellow to white. A viral illness carried by aphids and transmitted to the plants causes certain tulips to be varicolored. There were 2046 images in the training data, about 1000 images in the testing data, and 20 images in the validation data.
